# Face-Detection
We will uses one shot learning using Google Facenet Model to recognize images.

TASK:

Please find the attached file. You are provided with 2 set of folders train and test. The train folder contains a single image and test folder contains 15 images. We want you to analyse the images and put a classification based on distance difference. Use PYTHON as language to design the application.
Identify face from each image
Extract features from the face using the Google's Facenet model
Calculate the distance (any distance which increase the accuracy based on a threshold value) between each image with the image in train folder
Find out the preprocessing steps which will reduce the initial distance
Again calculate the distance and make a report on how preprocessing reduces distance.
